Just before 2019 ended, Jen and I set out to review and plan our one-year resolution for the year of 2020, AKA, new year resolution. As part of my list of resolutions, I had set myself to reach a certain goal in kattis. It will be a busy yet exciting year ahead :)

### Things to be careful of, to avoid WA

---

1. `map.insert` doesn't replace value if it exists
   had to insert and then find and replace again

   using `map['foo'] = bar` is simpler

2. `#include <iomanip>` [DOCS](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip) for various io manipulation, such as `setw`, `setfill`, `hex`, and `uppercase`

### Things to be careful of, to avoid TLE

1.

### Shorthands that are useful

1. define query variables as global
   antipattern IRL, but we are problem-solving instead of software building :P
2. `#define psi pair<string, int>` for map usage

3. `stringstream ss(query)` is useful if needed to tokenize
4. `stream.peek() == EOF` can be used to detect if EOF

## View whether its on par with remote from `glol`

When only `local HEAD` is more recent than `remote`

`1231234561 - (HEAD -> feat/foo) My commit message (4 minutes ago) <Its Me>`

When `remote HEAD` is now on par with `local HEAD`

`1231234561 - (HEAD -> feat/foo, origin/feat/foo) My commit message (4 minutes ago) <Its Me>`

Usually, I would have seen it from `gst` instead where it notes how many commits my `local HEAD` is behind `remote`.

- [x] [shadow Dom: open/closed](https://blog.revillweb.com/open-vs-closed-shadow-dom-9f3d7427d1af)

      shadow Dom, prevents selectors from selecting them. I suppose it is meant to be used for third party widgets like implement of features. But current it requires quite a bit of work to create them.

      It offers two modes;
      - Open: user can still access it by observing the structure from the Dom.
      - Closed: user cannot access Dom elements from shadow root as it will always return null. But it can access the variables of this components. This if you know what variables are available, you can still reach the Dom elements.

## View whether its on par with remote from `glol`

When only `local HEAD` is more recent than `remote`

`1231234561 - (HEAD -> feat/foo) My commit message (4 minutes ago) <Its Me>`

When `remote HEAD` is now on par with `local HEAD`

`1231234561 - (HEAD -> feat/foo, origin/feat/foo) My commit message (4 minutes ago) <Its Me>`

Usually, I would have seen it from `gst` instead where it notes how many commits my `local HEAD` is behind `remote`.

## TWIL

I always chance upon things that are interesting, but never consistently note them down for reference when I'm free.

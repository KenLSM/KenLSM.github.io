## TWIL

I always chance upon things that are interesting, but never consistently note them down for reference when I'm free.

- [x] Business/[ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) week
- [x] [Hamming Weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)

      Its a really quick way to calculate number of non-0 values in a series of digits (binary or non-binary)

- [x] `adb -s <DEVICE_ID> <COMMAND>` to target specific devices if you have many devices attached
- [ ] `autocannon` a program that can spam requests to server

  might be useful for stress testing?

- [ ] `node --inspect <file_name>` can open flamegraph in `chrome://inspect`?

  might be useful for the gameboy stuff

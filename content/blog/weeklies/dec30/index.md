## TWIL

I always chance upon things that are interesting, but never consistently note them down for reference when I'm free.

- [x] Business/[ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) week
- [x] [Hamming Weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)

      Its a really quick way to calculate number of non-0 values in a series of digits (binary or non-binary)

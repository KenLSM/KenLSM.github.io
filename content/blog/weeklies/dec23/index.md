## TWIL

I always chance upon things that are interesting, but never consistently note them down for reference when I'm free.

- [x] Google search console
      Didn't know that there's a search console, which is similar to analytics console
- [ ] google's scrapping page preview site
      I vaguely recalled that there's google site that provided an interface to view how google's crawler view your site. Might be education in terms of how your website is displayed on the web

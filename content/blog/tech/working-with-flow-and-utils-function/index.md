description: Working with flow and utils function
tag: drafts

How often do we face the issue where one single utils function serves different API structure and still require flow to work nicely with it?

```
type CarAPIResponse = {
  name: string,
  color: string,
  parts: {
    wheels_count: number,
  },
  price: number,
}

type TruckAPIResponse = {
  name: string,
  color: string,
  parts: {
    wheels_count: number,
  },
  price: number,
}

type CatAPIResponse = {
  name: string,
  color: string,
  body: {
    stripes_count: number,
  },
}

const cat: CatAPIResponse = {
  name: 'persian',
  color: 'beige',
  body: {
    stripes_count: 9,
  }
}
```

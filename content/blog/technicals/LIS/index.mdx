## Problem
Given a list of number find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).

For instance, in an array below:
```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
```

The length of the LIS should be 4.
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
As `[2, 2]` is not increasing we don't count them.

And in the case of:
```
[10, 11, 1, 2, 4, 9, 5, 6, 7]
```
The length of the LIS should be 6.
```
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

# Solution
## In Naïveté: O(2^n)

## Storing our Length/Assumption
Experiment: the longest subsequence when looking at first X.

Look only at the first 3 items
```
With vision of:   [10, 11, 1 ]
LIS is:           [10, 11, ❌]
```

Look only at the first 5 items
```
With vision of:   [10, 11,  1,  2,  3]
LIS is:           [❌, ❌,  1,  2,  3]
```

Look only at the first 6 items
```
With vision of:   [10, 11,  1,  2,  3, 12]
LIS is:           [10, 11, ❌, ❌, ❌, 12]
or                [❌, ❌,  1,  2,  3, ❌]
```

Look only at the first 7 items
```
With vision of:   [10, 11,  1,  2,  3, 12,  7]
LIS is:           [10, 11, ❌, ❌, ❌, 12, ❌]
or                [❌, ❌,  1,  2,  3, ❌,  7]
```

Look only at the first 8 items
```
With vision of:   [10, 11,  1,  2,  3, 12,  7,  5]
LIS is:           [❌, ❌,  1,  2,  3, ❌,  7, ❌]
or                [❌, ❌,  1,  2,  3, ❌, ❌,  5]
```

Notice that the incoming number is smaller than the largest in the subsequence.
Observation:
- cannot remove historical LIS
- should duplicate a new array to store items
  - O(n)
- find the index that the incoming number can be placed and still maintain increasing subsequence
  - Linear search: O(n) or;
  - Binary search: O(logn)
- insert the incoming number, and cross out the rest of the numbers after incoming number
  - O(n)

But what about keeping all of them in the same array?

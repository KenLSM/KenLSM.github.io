As I am working as React Native developer in my day job, I too, have encounted the issue of Array.prototype.sort being [unstable](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/212).

> What? Array.sort is unstable? It's 2020, who is still using an unstable sorting algorithm?

Tht was what my initial thoughts were when I first discovered this fact. FYI, tc39 has [already](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1340) specified that Array.prototype.sort should be stable.

How to even build it? What do we need to build? Where's the executeable? 

Typing in those strange commands, which I've to assume it works. With courage I pushed the enter button and lo and behold, there's a whole build folder appearing in front of my eyes.

Running tests
... hermes tests
    - issit the same as test262?
    - recommended to add tests under `hermes/test/hermes/array-functions.js`
        - added some dumb tests there, no idea how to run the tests
        - using `build/bin/hermes -target=HBC -O hermes/test/hermes/array-functions.js`
          instead of running the whole test suite through `ninja check-hermes`
... ninja tests?
    - `ninja check-hermes`
        seems to only run test under `hermes/unittests`


Alrighty, got the test cases out, and compilation out. Diving into the code! First, to start, where is the file we should be looking at? As pointed out by `dulinriley`, he adviced us to start looking from `lib/VM/JSLib/Array.cpp` and observe that `arrayPrototypeSort` is the function we are looking at.

```
  StandardSortModel sm(runtime, O, compareFn);

  // Use our custom sort routine. We can't use std::sort because it performs
  // optimizations that allow it to bypass calls to std::swap, but our swap
  // function is special, since it needs to use the internal Object functions.
  if (LLVM_UNLIKELY(quickSort(&sm, 0u, len) == ExecutionStatus::EXCEPTION))
    return ExecutionStatus::EXCEPTION;

  return O.getHermesValue();
```

For those that are unfamiliar, `LLVM_UNLIKELY` is an branching optimization for the compiler to opt for a certain path to take.

Segue into branches
---
Branches are one of the worst nightmare for a CPU as the CPU cannot utilize [instruction pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining) efficiently as only one of the branch is eventually taken. Work done from the other path, if evaluated, would be discarded. Thus, it has to pick one that is most `LIKELY` to be eventually taken.
```
func foo() {
    if(Math.random() < 0.01) { // path taken only 1% of the time
        doVeryExpensiveTask();
        return 1;
    }\
    doVeryTediousTask();
    return 2;
}
```

The CPU at on L2 can choose to assume that the path would be taken, and begin pipelining `doVeryExpensiveTask()` or do `doVeryTediousTask()`. Either one would be discarded.

Assuming that the CPU would always assume that every branching is taken, then it would waste 99% of its work.

While if the CPU assume that every branch is NOT taken, then it would waste only 1% of its work.

As a programmer, we can do better. By heuristics/intuition/statistics, we can predict whether the branch would be taken or not, and let the CPU know, through `LLVM_UNLIKELY|LLVM_LIKELY`.
